OVERVIEW:

ConDOR is an experimental reasoner for ontologies based on a new kind of
"consequence-based" reasoning procedure.

Currently ConDOR supports a fragment of OWL-2 which corresponds to the
DL SH.

INSTALLATION:

See the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

USAGE:

The binaries are located in the directory [/bin].
For the usage options type from this directory:

  ./condor --help     [on Linux & Mac]
  condor --help       [on Windows]

For usage examples see the directory [/examples]

REQUIREMENTS:

Currently ConDOR can only read ontologies in OWL-2 functional-style
syntax and supports a subsets of the constructors corresponding to SH.
The reasoner will ignore any constructor or axiom type that it 
doesn't support and issue a warning. This hould not result in any 
unsound inferences.

For the description of OWL-2 functional-style syntax, see:
http://www.w3.org/TR/owl2-syntax/

OWL ontologies in other formats can be converted into OWL-2 functional
syntax using Protege version 4.1 or higher.

the menu:
